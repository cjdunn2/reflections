This week I wanted to look for a data visualization that was the compound work of many data sets. Until this point, most of the data
I have observed is within a single data set and cross-references said data internally. This visualization is the culmination of a digital
experiment that aggregates a plethora of demographic variables combed with death statistics. Then generating an interactive data visualization,
able to somewhat creatively and accurately predict the potential cause and timeline for a specified death. 
While that is a strong hyperbole, the outcome given is a statistically significant one. 
Moving forward I would like to use data visualization to be able to assume about a cross-compared data set.
