This week I wanted to look for a data visualization that was the compound work of many data sets. Until this point, most of the data
I have observed is within a single data set and cross-references said data internally. This visualization is the culmination of a digital
experiment that aggregates a plethora of demographic variables combed with death statistics. Then generating an interactive data visualization,
able to somewhat creatively and accurately predict the potential cause and timeline for a specified death. 
While that is a strong hyperbole, the outcome given is a statistically significant one. 
Moving forward I would like to use data visualization to be able to assume about a cross-compared data set.

This is a data visualization of dialauge lines from Star Wars. The data is accumulated from the entire series. It focuses on dialauge from
6 Characters all of which being main characters. This data visualization stood out to me because most of the previous vixualiations I have
oberved are ojectively science based. This visualization is the first I have encounted with a theme that plays into the interactivity
of the viz. This visualiztion uses dots to mark dialogue with the size of dots entailing the force of the line on other characters. 
Additionally, the position of the dots (high or low) indicated whehter the dialogue has a positive or negative sentiment. These are 
techniques that we have seen and used within our project before. Moreover, there is interactivty in selecting the data we want to see, 
which is also something we have been talking about in class. The portion of this viz that stands out is that it uses its theme to make
sense to its viewer. It is only readable if you understand the morality of light and dark and how much that atters within the scope of 
star wars. Being a fan of these movies increases the impact the visualization can have. I found this to be very unique among the 
visualizations I had seen before.
